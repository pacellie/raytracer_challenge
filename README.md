# Learning Rust - The Ray Tracer Challenge

Learning Rust by implementing the [Ray Tracer Challenge](http://www.raytracerchallenge.com/). For now I've implemented chapters 1-16, bounding boxes found in the bonus chapter, and some extensions such as Simplex and Fractal Noise! The image directory contains some eye candy, the bin directory the corresponding examples. Be aware that renderig the teapot example takes a few minutes, all other examples should render quite quickly <<1min.
